# Optimal Advertising Campaign Strategy

## Executive Summary

This project explores an optimal strategy for digital advertising campaign allocation with an initial budget of £1 million. Through comprehensive analysis, it has been identified that traditional linear spending models oversimplify the complexities of market dynamics, particularly the relationship between budget allocation and cost-per-click (CPC).

## Key Insights

- CPC rates significantly increase beyond a budget threshold of £20,000 per keyword.
- "retail UK" is the most cost-effective keyword at £3.93 per click, while "dua lipa gloves" is the least effective at £82.30 per click.
- Full £1M budget allocation proved inefficient due to nonlinear CPC rate scaling with increased spending.

## Recommended Strategy

A conservative, data-driven approach was developed using piecewise linear optimization, suggesting an initial total budget of £75,000, primarily distributed among the top-performing keywords:

- **retail UK**
- **free shipping UK**
- **spotted dress**

Initial allocations per keyword should not exceed £20,000 to avoid performance deterioration.

## Risk Management

- Emphasizes strategic keyword diversification.
- Implements strict performance monitoring and regular budget reallocations.
- Monthly reviews of CPC trends and competitor behavior to maintain efficiency.

## Future Recommendations

Further analyses should include:

- Seasonal impacts on CPC rates.
- Cross-platform attribution modeling.
- Competitive bidding behaviors.

## Performance Metrics

Success measures should consider:

- Cross-platform attribution data.
- Long-term customer value indicators.

This strategy balances short-term campaign efficiency with long-term strategic flexibility, optimizing spending effectiveness based on real-time performance data.
